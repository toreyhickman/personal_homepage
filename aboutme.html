  I'm a graduate of <a href="http://devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a> Chicago, an intensive programming course that teaches web application development with Ruby on Rails, utilizing pair programming, version control, and test- driven development.

  I’m excited to continue learning and growing as a web developer. I’m passionate about user experience and user interface design—I enjoy attractive applications that are effortless for the user. I also really enjoy designing the backend processes that facilitate ease of use, specifically database schema and working with ActiveRecord.
